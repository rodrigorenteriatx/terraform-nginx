  # sudo sed -i -r -e '/^#|^$/ d' /etc/ssh/sshd_config: This command modifies the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file in-place (-i). It uses the sed stream editor to delete (d) all lines that start with a # (which are comments in the sshd_config file) or that are empty (^$). The -r option enables extended regular expressions, which allows the | character to be used to mean "or".

      # On Linux, user sessions are tracking using a kernel-side session id, however, this session id is not recorded by OpenSSH.
      # Additionally, only tools such as systemd and auditd record the process session id.
      # On other OSes, the user session id is not necessarily recorded at all kernel-side.
